# Automatic Download Sorter Script
 A script to automatically sort downloaded pdf and image files to specified folders.

 ## Usage
 To use this script, simply download the .py file, change the source/destination directory names in it (as marked in the file) to the directory names on your machine, and run the script. \
 If you instead prefer to run this script as a constant background process, after downloading it change the file extension from .py to .pyw, and double click it to run. \
 If you would then like to end the background process, you can do so by using the  ** taskkill /IM pythonw.exe /F ** command in the terminal.
