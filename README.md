# Automatic Download Sorter Script
 A script to automatically sort downloaded pdf and image files to specified folders.

 ## Usage
 To use this script, simply download the .py file, change the source/destination directory names in it (as marked in the file) to the directory names on your machine, and run the script. If you have any pdfs or image files currently in the source folder, it will automatically sort them to your specified destination folders. It will continue to run and sort downloaded files until you manually stop the script from running.\
 If you instead prefer to run this script as a constant background process with no GUI, after downloading it change the file extension from .py to .pyw, and double click it to run. \
 If you would then like to end the background process, you can do so by using the  **taskkill /IM pythonw.exe /F** command in the terminal.
